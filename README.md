# Restaurant-Customer Ratings Database using SQL - Bigquery
With the increase in the number of restaurants people often get confused about the
best-suited restaurant according to their preferences. In addition to that, people face a hard time
finding out the best place and food to eat, especially when they are new to that place. The
Restaurant-consumer rating database helps build a restaurant recommendation system that
suggests a top-n-list of restaurants based on the user cuisine preferences. This will save time for
users while choosing their preferred restaurants. It is so convenient to get a list of restaurants that
match our preferences without much clicking, comparing, and browsing through a long list of
reviews for every single business. In addition, restaurants can also improve their business by
providing better services based on user ratings.
